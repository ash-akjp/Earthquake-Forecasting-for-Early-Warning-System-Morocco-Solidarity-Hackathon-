Early-warning alerts are essential for earthquake
mitigation. Having a solid early warning system
can save lives, reduce injuries, and better coordinate
emergency response organizations. Currently,
early-warning alerts are sent around three
to four seconds after an earthquake starts. In
this project, we aim to use machine learning to
predict the occurrence of earthquakes using waveform
traces and improve the early warning system
by sending the warning before its occurrence. We
chose a 10-second window as our training samples
only consist of 120-second waveforms. In future
work, we will want to use time series data of a
much longer duration and predict the occurrence
of an earthquake at an even earlier stage.
